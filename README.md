# Data-Project-US-Debt
UNSW Code Project

The Final Notebook is "usdebt2.ipynb"



My Data Set relies on the Data from the US Treasury Monthly Statement of Debt.

It has been formatted so if you dont have the main file saved on your computer, it will pull the most recent data using the API request. It is hardcoded for 3785 lines, seen in the URL --> That amount will change past August 2021 as more data comes out. 

This information is useful as a deeper dive into what caused an increase in US Debt, both Public and Government. It highlights and provides insight into times of Crisis, namely the GFC (Sept 2009) and Covid-19 (March 2020). Pay close attention to the difference in Notes and Bills bought during those times to gain insight into changing market sentiment during times of volatility.


I believe this information is important to understand with the US Dollar being the Global Reserve Currency. With the amount of Debt increasing, the US dollar valuation has remained the same until recently (May, June, July) with inflation reaching 5% each month. 


Understanding the increasing Total Debt of the US gives insight into how inflation will hit the rest of the world and what they may change within their own Financial Policy to reduce the chances of repeating the same mistakes.
